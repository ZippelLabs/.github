We are a security R&D team specializing in cryptography. Our mission is to provide **secure solutions** to modern cryptographic challenges and make systems **secure and future-proof**. We conduct **security audits** for zero-knowledge protocols, cryptographic algorithms, smart contracts, and more â€“ helping projects find vulnerabilities and strengthen their code before deployment.



## Get in Touch

*Weâ€™re always excited to collaborate* - whether itâ€™s discussing a new cryptographic idea, building secure software, or security review code for vulnerabilities . Feel free to **star our repositories** if you find them useful, open an issue or pull request to contribute, and reach out if youâ€™d like to work together. **[Contact us](mailto:zippelsec@gmail.com)** â€“ weâ€™d love to hear from you! ðŸ’¬
