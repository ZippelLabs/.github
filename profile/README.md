- Who we are: ZippelLabs is not just an audit firm, we are security mindset developers of the [ZP1 zkVM](https://github.com/ZippelLabs/ZP1) with external  top-tier Independent auditors to strengthen audits requirements, [zkVMs-bugs project](https://github.com/ZippelLabs/zkVMs-bugs), and [Initiatives for security of privacy preserving protocols-wip](https://github.com/ZippelLabs/privacy-proof-security). We understand the complexity of ZK proofs systems because we build, review, research them daily. 
- **Track Record**: We have secured $10B+ TVL across all chains which inlcludes $100M+ in privacy preserving projects.And constantly securing protocols.
- Our Mission: To accelerate the adoption of privacy preserving protocols, we run a Subsidized Security Review Program. We offer deep, manual, line by line security reviews at significantly below-market rates to projects we believe are critical to the ecosystem.
